# Engage for Windows

Engage is a personal project for learning WinAppSDK, WinUI3, and Windows development in general. I'll likely just keep adding tabs for random features / things I want to try. Or it may end up going in some as-of-yet unknown direction, who knows! üòç

## Current Features

Engage currently includes the following features:

- Chat with GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.
- Set or change API key in Settings.
- Send messages as GPT.
- Multiple conversations via tabs.

2. Open the Engage solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the solution.

Note that Engage requires the WinAppSDK and WinUI3 frameworks to be installed in order to build and run the application.

## Contributing

Contributions to Engage are welcome! However, please note that this is a personal project for learning purposes, and I may not be able to review and merge pull requests in a timely manner. Additionally, as I am new to GitHub collaboration, it may take me some time to learn how to manage the repository and review pull requests effectively.

That being said, if you would like to contribute to the project, please feel free üòä
