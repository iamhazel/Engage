## Contributing

Contributions to Engage are welcome! However, please note that this is a personal project for learning purposes, and I may not be able to review and merge pull requests in a timely manner. Additionally, as I am new to GitHub collaboration, it may take me some time to learn how to manage the repository and review pull requests effectively.

That being said, if you would like to contribute to the project, please feel free ðŸ˜Š
